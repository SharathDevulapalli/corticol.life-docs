# CORTICOL: High-Pressure Cognitive Hardening

> **[ACCESS GRANTED] // SYSTEM BREACH v1.4.0**
>
> Most mindfulness apps try to bring you peace. **CORTICOL does the opposite.**
> We build mental resilience by intentionally overloading your cognitive bandwidth.

## 🛑 The Concept
The modern world is a sensory flood. Most people drown in it. **CORTICOL** is the training ground where you learn to swim.

Built on the principle of **"Cognitive Control Training,"** this system forces you to manage a chaotic stream of math, memory, and motor tasks while battling digital distractions.
* **When you break:** The system forces a "Vagal Brake" reset.
* **When you succeed:** You receive a surgical audit of your "Neural Stack."

## ⚡ System Modules

### 1. The Neural Chaos Simulator ("The Flood")
A barrage of overlapping cognitive modules. Difficulty dynamically adjusts based on your streaks—expect screen shakes, color flashes, and glitch effects.
* **Math Audit:** Rapid arithmetic under time pressure.
* **Typing Protocol:** High-speed string entry for "system stability."
* **Stroop Effect Filter:** Cognitive inhibition tests (Color/Word conflict).
* **N-Back Buffer:** Working memory sequence tracking.
* **Moral Decision Nodes:** Instantaneous choice-making under conflict.

### 2. Autonomic Regulation Tools
* **Panic Grounding:** Manual override (Spacebar) to initiate rhythmic breathing synchronization.
* **Vagal Brake Recovery:** Automated safety lockout forcing a tactile "re-calibration" of focus after high failure rates.

### 3. Deep Work Mode ("The Void")
A counter-experience for high-output thinking.
* **Neural Reforestation:** Focus for 30-minute blocks and watch a digital forest grow in real-time.
* **Harmonic Soundscapes:** Procedural LFO-modulated sinusoids to anchor brainwaves.

### 4. Surgical Performance Auditing
Powered by **Gemini 3 Flash**. We don't just give you a score; we give you a cybernetic critique.
* **Stack Profiling:** Your brain mapped as hardware: **CPU** (Speed), **RAM** (Memory), **Firewall** (Inhibition).
* **Bio-Rhythm Analysis:** Tracks historical data to identify your peak cognitive throughput hours.
